A logger is a tool used to record messages (like errors or info) during code execution for debugging or monitoring.

## Project

Must-Have:
- Deployed link (working, public)
- GitHub repo link
- Good looking UI as per eraser (https://app.eraser.io/workspace/OVKKJzx4PRQBL7rScVg8)
- Good code quality (clean, readable, DRY)
- Proper file structure (components, assets, styles, etc.)
- Meaningful commit messages (atomic, descriptive)
- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, aria tags)
- No usage of proprietary or problematic assets without license
- No usage of copyrighted material

Bonus:
- Usage of React.js
- Lighthouse performance score above 90
- Micro-interactions (tasteful and not overdone)
- Deployment CI/CD pipeline (like with Vercel)
- Custom 404 page
- Easter eggs or thoughtful UX touches
